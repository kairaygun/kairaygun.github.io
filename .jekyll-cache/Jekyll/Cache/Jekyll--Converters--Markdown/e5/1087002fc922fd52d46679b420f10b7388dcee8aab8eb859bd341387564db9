I"€<p>There are many ways to approach learning <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and this is one of many. I‚Äôm also a firm believer that education should be <em>free</em> and I cringe whenever I think about the Catch-22s and underpinning of the current tech hype. Learning a skillset requires a sustainable income to buy a seat into a programming bootcamp with neck-breathing mentoring. Mostly everyone from the middle and working class can‚Äôt afford to <em>not</em> work. Hence, I‚Äôm curating this with <strong>free</strong> resources alone. Don‚Äôt spend a penny on the same resource that‚Äôs packaged differently.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails is a web application framework designed around Ruby, so it is recommended to start off with Ruby first before jumping into Rails. Ruby in itself is a particular language, and even though I‚Äôm familiar with other programming languages (Python, Java, C++, etc.) there are little things in Ruby that makes me <em>think</em> differently when I‚Äôm problem solving. So yes, learn Ruby first, then Rails!</p>

<h2>Learn Ruby First</h2>
<p>You should be in a comfortable level of familiarity once you go through these Ruby resources especially if you tackle the optional recommendations. The important part is to remain consistent, and one way to track that is by logging your study hours.</p>

<p>One last tip, do not copy and paste, <em>please</em>. Examine the material thoroughly, and if you‚Äôre feeling a little stuck, take a glance at other solutions, or ask for help, but don‚Äôt verbatimly use someone else‚Äôs answer. There is also no sense in reinventing the wheel, so read through the documentation. It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt get it at first because ‚Äúif there is no struggle, there is no progress‚Äù and being uncomfortable is a good place to be in when you‚Äôre learning.</p>
