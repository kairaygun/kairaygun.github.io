<h3>Research</h3>

Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences provide a graphic run down of GAPs (National Good Agricultural Practices) food safety protocols. Through GAP, growers are educated preventetive measures that reduce the risk of spreading microbial infection in fruits and vegetables. I extracted the decision trees and used it to display a wizard following Cornell's logic.

<h3>Processs</h3>

Shubzilla provided me with image references from Fallout (video game) and screenshots from Godzilla. Most of the images have a consistent theme of an element that is either in flames or in smoke. Keeping that in mind, I went with a palette that resembled these themes but I did not want the website to feel harsh, so I used a gradient and softer and warmer reds to represent the look she wanted.
